Developed by:
- Isaac Martínez
- Jesús González


Metaballs in 2D developed in Raspberry Pi using C and SDL for our Low Level Programming subject

Focus was on optimization of the inner loop, achieved by:
- Unrolling loops
- Precalculation of the Metaballs
- Minimizing the amount of complex operations in the inner loop
